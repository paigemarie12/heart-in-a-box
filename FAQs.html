 <h1>Heart In A Box</h1>
 <p>Frequenty Ased Questions</p>
 <div class="wrapper2">
  <div class="box2 a">Q: How long will I have to wait for a donor heart?</div>
  <div class="box2 b">A: It is not possible to predict how long you will have to wait for a donor heart. Some patients wait days while others wait weeks, months or years. Organ offers are made on the basis of: <br />
-Blood type (the donor heart must come from a donor with the same or compatible blood type as you) <br />
-Heart size <br />
-UNOS status (1A, 1B or 2) <br />
-Waiting time (how long you've been on the waiting list)</div>
  <div class="box2 c">Q: Are there any donor-related factors that could affect the success of the transplant surgery or my health following surgery?</div>
  <div class="box2 d">A: Yes. These factors could include, but are not limited to: <br />
-Infection in the donor that is not detected by the pretransplant screening (e.g., HIV, hepatitis or other infectious disease) <br />
-The condition of the donor heart <br />
-The donor's health history</div>
  <div class="box2 e">Q: How will I know if I'm having a rejection?</div>
  <div class="box2 f">A: We will teach you the symptoms of rejection so you will know when to call us. We will schedule you for biopsies and echocardiograms after you receive your new heart. The biopsy can tell us about rejection when it is in your cells. The echocardiogram will show any decrease in heart function. If the biopsy or echocardiogram shows you are having a rejection, your medication doses may be increased or new medications may be given.</div>
