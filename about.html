  <div class="box sidebar">TransMedics developed the OCS Heart to increase transplant volume, improve patient outcomes, and reduce system-wide costs. Surgeons now have the potential to reduce the damaging effects of cold ischemia and instead maintain the quality and function of accepted organs by perfusing the donated heart from harvest to transplant. Surgeons can also monitor key parameters of the metabolically active donor heart ex-vivo and use their clinical judgment to assess the suitability of a donor heart prior to transplant. By perfusing the heart from harvest to transplant, the OCS maintains the heart in a near-physiological, metabolically active state that may allow surgeons to preserve LVH and long-distance hearts and by monitoring key parameters of the metabolically active heart ex-vivo, surgeons may use their medical judgement to assess a potentially suitable heart's quality and function outside the brain-death environment.</div>
